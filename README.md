### Flutter Camera Greenscreen plugin

A fork of the [main Flutter camera plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/camera) to add chroma-key greenscreen functionality.

This repo was created using [this guide for forking a single package from a monorepo](https://gist.github.com/alfredringstad/ac0f7a1e081e9ee485e653b6a8351212). That guide also contains details on how to merge in any future updates to the main plugin.
